# ETRS89toOSGB36_OSTN15_OSGM15_matlab

The function aims to convert ETRS (lat,lon, ellipsoid height) to OSGB36 (Easting, Northing, Orthometric height) using the most current projections (OSTN15 and OSGM15),
by using the correction file downloaded from Ordnance Survey. The results matches the online service (https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/gps/transformation/) perfectly.
